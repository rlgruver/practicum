Variables
X1 in [-100, 100], 
X2 in [-100, 100];

#Separate variables with commas, end field with semi-colon
#List variables in the format "var in [domain lb, domain ub]"
#lb = lower bound, ub = upper bound

Objective
function = (1.5 - x1 * (1 - x2))^2 + (2.25 - x1*(1 - x2^2))^2 + (2.625 - x1*(1-x2^3))^2,
range = [-1e+8,1e+8];

#Separate objective function and range with a comma 
#End field with semi-colon
