#This section is for any constant values that you wish to use in the
#Constraints section. This is an optional section, and should be removed

CONSTANTS
t=0.000123,
g=9.8;

#This section is for listing ALL variables used in the Objective function
#and/or Constraints. Separate variables with commas, and end the field with
#a semi-colon. List variables in the format "var in [domain lb, domain ub]"
#lb = lower bound, ub = upper bound.

VARIABLES
x1 in [-10, 10],
x2 in [-10, 10],
x3 in [-10, 10],
x4 in [-10, 10];

#This section is for the Objective Function. Make sure that all variables
#used in the Objective Function are listed in the Variables section.
#End the field with a semi-colon.

OBJECTIVE
100*(x1^2 - x2)^2 + (x1 - 1)^2 + 100*(x2^2 - x3)^2 + (x2 - 1)^2 + 100*(x3^2 - x4)^2 + (x3 - 1)^2;

#This section is for any constraints that must be satisfied by the variables
#used in the Objective Function. This is an optional section, and should
#be removed completely if not used. Separate entries with commas, and end
#the field with a semi-colon.

CONSTRAINTS
x1<=x2,
x3 = x1 * t,
abs(x4) >= g;
