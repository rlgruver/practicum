#This section is for any constant values that you wish to use in the
#Constraints section. This is an OPTIONAL section, and SHOULD BE REMOVED
#COMPLETELY IF NOT USED. Separate entries with a comma and a line break.

CONSTANTS
t=0.000123,
g=9.8

#This section is for listing ALL variables used in the Objective Function
#and Constraints sections. Separate entries with a comma and a line
#break. List variables in the format "var in [domain lb, domain ub]" where
#lb = lower bound, ub = upper bound.

VARIABLES
x1 in [-10, 10],
x2 in [-10, 10],
x3 in [-10, 10],
x4 in [-10, 10]

#This section is for the Objective Function. Make sure that all variables
#used in the objective function are listed in the Variables section.

OBJECTIVE
100*(x1^2 - x2)^2 + (x1 - 1)^2 + 100*(x2^2 - x3)^2 + (x2 - 1)^2 + 100*(x3^2 - x4)^2 + (x3 - 1)^2

#This section is for any constraints that must be satisfied by the variables
#used in the Objective Function. This is an OPTIONAL section, and SHOULD
#BE REMOVED COMPLETELY IF NOT USED. Separate entries with commas.

CONSTRAINTS
x1 <= x2,
x3 = x1 * t,
abs(x4) >= g
